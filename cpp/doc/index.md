## SIMILAR C++ Port and Python Bindings Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the **C++ ports** of the SIMILAR ecosystem and their **Python bindings**.

- **`cpp_port.md`** – Overview of the SIMILAR C++ microkernel and extended kernel, build instructions, and design notes.
- **`python_bindings.md`** – Overview of the Python bindings built on top of the C++ engine (JamFree, Similar2Logo, web UI), installation, and usage examples.
- **`jamfree_cpp.md`** – JamFree C++ engine overview (components, performance, web UI) with links to existing optimization and GPU docs.
- **`similar2logo_cpp.md`** – Similar2Logo C++ multithreaded engine overview and how it plugs into the Python DSL.
- **`migration_from_java.md`** – How to read the original Java documentation in `src/doc` when working with the C++/Python stack.

The original Java documentation and conceptual material are located in `src/doc`. The files here focus specifically on:

- The **C++ translation** of the SIMILAR framework.
- The **JamFree C++ traffic engine** and its Python bindings.
- The **Similar2Logo C++ multithreaded engine** and its Python integration.
